    "\n",
    "In a Python program, the if statement is how you perform this sort of decision-making. It allows for **conditional** execution of a statement or group of statements based on the value of an expression.\n",
    "## if Statement\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <expr>:\n",
    "    <statement>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If `<expr>` is true (evaluates to a value that is “truthy”), then `<statement>` is executed. If `<expr>` is false, then `<statement>` is skipped over and not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, all the statements at the matching indentation level (lines 2 to 5) are considered part of the same block. The entire block is executed if `<expr>` is true, or skipped over if `<expr>` is false. Either way, execution proceeds with `<following_statement>` (line 6) afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <expr>:\n",
    "    <statement>\n",

    "else:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is also syntax for branching execution based on several alternatives. For this, use one or more `elif` (short for `else if`) clauses. Python evaluates each `<expr>` in turn and executes the suite corresponding to the first that is true. If none of the expressions are true, and an `else` clause is specified, then its suite is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <expr>:\n",

    "<expr1> if <conditional_expr> else <expr2>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Using a lengthy `if/elif/else` series can be a little inelegant, especially when the actions are simple statements like `print()`. In many cases, there may be a more Pythonic way to accomplish the same thing. Here’s one possible alternative to the example above using f-string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 'Joe'\n",
    "\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"I don't know who you are!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- An `if` statement with `elif` clauses uses short-circuit evaluation, analogous to what you saw with the `and` and `or` operators. Once one of the expressions is found to be true and its block is executed, none of the remaining expressions are tested. This is demonstrated below. The second expression contains a division by zero, and the third references an undefined variable `var`. Either would raise an error, but neither is evaluated because the first condition specified is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 'a' in 'bar':\n",
    "    print('foo')\n",
    "elif 1/0:\n",
