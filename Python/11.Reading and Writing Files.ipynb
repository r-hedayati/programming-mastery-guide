    "# Reading and Writing Files \n",
    "\n",
    "Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Header**: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)\n",
    "- **Data**: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor\n",
    "- **End of file (EOF)**: special character that indicates the end of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Paths\n",
    "When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Folder Path:** the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash `/` (Unix) or backslash `\\` (Windows)\n",
    "2. **File Name:** the actual name of the file\n",
    "3. **Extension:** the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (`.`) used to indicate the file type\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Ending anc Encoding \n",
    "- Note that each line ended with `\\n` in Unix or Mac, and with `\\r\\n` in Windows. \n",
    "- An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters. This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character. The two most common encodings are the [ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/) and [UNICODE](https://unicode.org/) Formats.\n",
    "- ASCII (store 128 characters) is actually a subset of [Unicode (stores 1,114,112 characters)](https://realpython.com/python-encodings-guide/) (UTF-8), meaning that ASCII and Unicode share the same numerical to character values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and Closing a File in Python\n",
    "When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it. This is done by invoking the `open()` built-in function. `open()` has a single required argument that is the path to the file. `open()` has a single return, the file object:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('myfile.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "After you open a file, the next thing to learn is how to close it.\n",
    "When you’re manipulating a file, there are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is closed properly, even when encountering an error. The first way to close a file is to use the `try-finally` block:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#first solution\n",
    "reader = open('myfile.txt')\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Further file processing goes here\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    reader.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second way to close a file is to use the `with statement`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#second solution\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt') as reader:\n",
    "    # Further file processing goes here\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most likely, you’ll also want to use the second positional argument, mode. This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to represent how you want to open the file. The default and most common is `'r'`, which represents opening the file in read-only mode as a text file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as reader:\n",
    "    # Further file processing goes here\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options for modes are [fully documented online](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open), but the most commonly used ones are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Character | Meaning|\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "|`'r'` | Open for reading (default)|\n",
    "|`'w'` | Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first|\n",
    "|`'rb'` or `'wb'` | Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Open Files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Method |What It Does|\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "|`.read(size=-1)` | This reads from the file based on the number of `size` bytes. If no argument is passed or `None` or `-1` is passed, then the entire file is read. |\n",
    "|`.readline(size=-1)` | This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or `None` or `-1` is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read. |\n",
    "|`.readlines()` | This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### iterating over each line in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "### first solution \n",
    "\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as reader:\n",
    "    # Read and print the entire file line by line\n",
    "    line = reader.readline()\n",
    "    while line != '':  # The EOF char is an empty string\n",
    "        print(line, end='')\n",
    "        line = reader.readline()\n",
    "        \n",
    "### second solution\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as reader:\n",
    "    for line in reader.readlines():\n",
    "        print(line, end='')\n",
    "        \n",
    "### simplify the second solution \n",
    "\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as reader:\n",
    "    # Read and print the entire file line by line\n",
    "    for line in reader:\n",
    "        print(line, end='')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This final approach is more Pythonic and can be quicker and more memory efficient. Therefore, it is suggested you use this instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Open Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s dive into writing files. As with reading files, file objects have multiple methods that are useful for writing to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Method\t|What It Does|\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "|`.write(string)`\t|This writes the string to the file.|\n",
    "|`.writelines(seq)`\t|This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. It’s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appending to a file \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'a') as a_writer:\n",
    "    a_writer.write('this is line 7')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## working with two files at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_path = 'myfile.txt'\n",
    "d_r_path = 'myfile_reversed.txt'\n",
    "with open(d_path, 'r') as reader, open(d_r_path, 'w') as writer:\n",
    "    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()\n",
    "    writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))\n",
    "```"
