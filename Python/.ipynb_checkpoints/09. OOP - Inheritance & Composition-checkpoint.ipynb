    "**Inheritance** models what is called a **relationship**. This means that when you have a **Derived** or **Child** class that inherits from a **Base** or **Parent** class, you created a relationship where **Derived** or **Child** is a specialized version of **Base** or **Parent**, meaning one class takes on the attributes and methods of another.\n",
    "Child classes can override or extend the attributes and methods of parent classes. In other words, child classes inherit all of the parent’s attributes and methods but can also specify attributes and methods that are unique to themselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Classes that inherit from another are called derived classes, subclasses, or subtypes.\n",
    "- Classes from which other classes are derived are called base classes or super classes.\n",
    "- A derived class is said to derive, inherit, or extend a base class.\n",

    "**Inheritance** and **composition** are two important concepts in object oriented programming that model the relationship between two classes. They are the building blocks of object oriented design, and they help programmers to write reusable code.\n",

    "Inheritance is represented using the [Unified Modeling Language](https://www.uml.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a base class Animal and you derive from it to create a Horse class. The inheritance relationship states that a Horse **is an** Animal. This means that Horse inherits the interface and implementation of Animal, and Horse objects can be used to replace Animal objects in the application.\n",
    "This is known as the **Liskov substitution principle**. The principle states that “in a computer program, if `S` is a subtype of `T`, then objects of type `T` may be replaced with objects of type `S` without altering any of the desired properties of the program”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a concept that models a **has a** relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class `Component`. This relationship means that a `Composite` **has a** `Component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, your `Horse` class can be composed by another object of type `Tail`. Composition allows you to express that relationship by saying a `Horse` **has a** `Tail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition enables you to reuse code by adding objects to other objects, as opposed to inheriting the interface and implementation of other classes. Both Horse and Dog classes can leverage the functionality of Tail through composition without deriving one class from the other.\n",

    "2. **The base class implementation**: The derived class inherits the code that implements the class interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you’ll want to inherit the implementation of a class, but you will want to implement multiple interfaces, so your objects can be used in different situations.

    "\n",
    "- **Use inheritance to reuse an implementation**: Your derived classes should leverage most of their base class implementation. They must also model an **is a** relationship. A `Temporary` class might also have a width and a height, but a `Temporary` **is not** a `Shape`, so you should not use inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement an interface to be reused**: When you want your class to be reused by a specific part of your application, you implement the required interface in your class, but you don’t need to provide a base class, or inherit from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If you are not careful, inheritance can lead you to a huge hierarchical structure of classes that is hard to understand >and maintain. This is known as the **class explosion problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition**is an object oriented design concept that models a **has a** relationship. In composition, a class known as **composite** contains an object of another class known to as **component**. In other words, a composite class **has a** component of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows composite classes to reuse the implementation of the components it contains. The composite class doesn’t inherit the component class interface, but it can leverage its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition relation between two classes is considered **loosely coupled**. That means that changes to the component class rarely affect the composite class, and changes to the composite class never affect the component class. This provides better adaptability to change and allows applications to introduce new requirements without affecting existing code. When looking at two competing software designs, one based on inheritance and another based on composition, the composition solution usually is the most flexible. You can now look at how composition works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Color:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, hex, rgb):\n",

    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} - HEX({self.hex}) - RGB{self.rgb}\"\n",
    "    \n",

    "You can now add the `Color` to the `Rectangle` class through composition:\n",

    "## Choosing Between Inheritance and Composition in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a class A that provides an implementation and interface you want to reuse in another class B. Your initial thought is that you can derive B from A and inherit both the interface and implementation. To be sure this is the right design, you follow theses steps:\n",
    "1. **Evaluate B is an A:** Think about this relationship and justify it. Does it make sense?\n",
    "2. **Evaluate A is a B:** Reverse the relationship and justify it. Does it also make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can justify both relationships, then you should never inherit those classes from one another. Let’s look at a more concrete example.\n",
    "You have a class `Rectangle` which exposes an .area property. You need a class `Square`, which also has an .area. It seems that a `Square` is a special type of `Rectangle`, so maybe you can derive from it and leverage both the interface and implementation.\n",
    "Before you jump into the implementation, you use Liskov’s substitution principle to evaluate the relationship.\n",
    "A Square **is a** Rectangle because its area is calculated from the product of its `height` times its `length`. The constraint is that `Square.height` and `Square.length` must be equal.\n",
    "It makes sense. You can justify the relationship and explain why a `Square` **is a** `Rectangle`. Let’s reverse the relationship to see if it makes sense.\n",
    "A `Rectangle` is a `Square` because its area is calculated from the product of its `height` times its `length`. The difference is that `Rectangle.height` and `Rectangle.width` can change independently.\n",
    "It also makes sense. You can justify the relationship and describe the special constraints for each class. This is a good sign that these two classes should never derive from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion \n",
    "Python, as an object oriented programming language, supports both inheritance and composition. You saw that inheritance is best used to model an **is a** relationship, whereas composition models a **has a** relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it’s hard to see what the relationship between two classes should be, but you can follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use inheritance over composition in Python** to model a clear **is a** relationship. First, justify the relationship between the derived class and its base. Then, reverse the relationship and try to justify it. If you can justify the relationship in both directions, then you should not use inheritance between them.\n",

    "- **Use inheritance over composition in Python** to leverage both the interface and implementation of the base class.\n",
