    "\n",
    "Rather than creating an empty list and adding each element to the end, you simply define the list and its contents at the same time by following this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [expression for member in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every list comprehension in Python includes three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **expression** is the member itself, a call to a method, or any other valid expression that returns a value. In the example above, the expression `i * i` is the square of the member value.\n",
    "- **member** is the object or value in the list or iterable. In the example above, the member value is `i`.\n",
    "- **iterable** is a list, set, sequence, generator, or any other object that can return its elements one at a time. In the example above, the iterable is `range(10)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Another Example**\n",
    " >```python\n",

    "## Using `map()` object\n",
    "`map()` provides an alternative approach that’s based in functional programming. You pass in a function and an iterable, and `map()` will create an object. This object contains the output you would get from running each iterable element through the supplied function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First Example: \n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">def func(a):\n",

    "## Using Conditional Logic\n",
    "The most common way to add conditional logic to a list comprehension is to add a conditional to the end of the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]\n",
    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "sentence = 'the rocket came back from mars'\n",
    "vowels = [i for i in sentence if i in 'aeiou']\n",
    "vowels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place the conditional at the end of the statement for simple filtering, but what if you want to change a member value instead of filtering it out? In this case, it’s useful to place the conditional near the beginning of the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [expression (if conditional) for member in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">original_prices = [1.25, -9.45, 10.22, 3.78, -5.92, 1.16]\n",
    ">prices = [i if i > 0 else 0 for i in original_prices]\n",

    "# Set and Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "While the list comprehension in Python is a common tool, you can also create set and dictionary comprehensions. A **set** comprehension is almost exactly the same as a list comprehension in Python. The difference is that set comprehensions make sure the output contains no duplicates. You can create a set comprehension by using curly braces instead of brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python \n",
    ">quote = \"life, uh, finds a way\"\n",
    ">unique_vowels = {i for i in quote if i in 'aeiou'}\n",
    ">unique_vowels\n",
    ">```\n",
    "- Second example (create a reverese dictonary): \n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">my_dict={\n",
    ">one:'1'\n",
    ">two:'2'\n",
    ">}\n",
    ">reverse_my_dict={value: key for key, value in my_dict.items()}\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third example \n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">squares = {i: i * i for i in range(10)}\n",
    ">ans = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}\n",
