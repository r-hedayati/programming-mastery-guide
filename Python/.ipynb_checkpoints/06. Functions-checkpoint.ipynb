    "## Functions in Python\n",
    "You may be familiar with the mathematical concept of a **function**. A function is a relationship or mapping between one or more inputs and a set of outputs. In fact, appropriate function definition and use is so critical to proper software development that virtually all modern programming languages support both built-in and user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some built-in python examples: \n",
    "- `id()`: takes one argument and returns that object’s unique integer identifier\n",
    "- `len()`: returns the length of the argument passed to it\n",
    "- `any`: takes an iterable as its argument and returns `True` if any of the items in the iterable are truthy and `False` otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these built-in functions performs a specific task. The code that accomplishes the task is defined somewhere, but you don’t need to know where or even how the code works. All you need to know about is the function’s interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What **arguments** (if any) it takes\n",
    "2. What **values** (if any) it returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Why functions are good: \n",
    "1) Abstraction and Reusability\n",
    "2) Modularity\n",
    "3) Namespace Separation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Funtions Calls and Definition\n",
    "The usual syntax for defining a Python function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def <function_name>([<parameters>]):\n",
    "    <statement(s)>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The components of the definition are explained in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Meaning |\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "| `def` | The keyword that informs Python that a function is being defined\n",
    "| `<function_name>` | A valid Python identifier that names the function\n",
    "| `<parameters>` | An optional, comma-separated list of parameters that may be passed to the function\n",
    "| `:`\t| Punctuation that denotes the end of the Python function header (the name and parameter list)\n",
    "| `<statement(s)>` | A block of valid Python statements (body of the function)\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for calling a Python function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<function_name>([<arguments>])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `<arguments>` are the values passed into the function. They correspond to the `<parameters>` in the Python function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stub` function: Occasionally, you may want to define an empty function that does nothing. This is referred to as a **stub**, which is usually a temporary placeholder for a Python function that will be fully implemented at a later time. Just as a block in a control structure can’t be empty, neither can the body of a function. To define a stub function, use the `pass` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Argument passing\n",
    "1) **Positional arguments**: The most straightforward way to pass arguments to a Python function is with **positional arguments** (also called **required arguments**). In the function definition, you specify a comma-separated list of parameters inside the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# formal parameters\n",
    "# function definition\n",
    "def f(qty, item, price):\n",
    "    print(f'{qty} {item} cost ${price:.2f}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "# actual parameters\n",
    "# function call\n",
    "x = 25\n",
    "f(6, 'bananas', x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Common errors in positional arguments: \n",
    "- Too few arguments: `f(6, 'bananas')`\n",
    "- Too many arguments: `f(6, 'bananas', 1.74, 'kumquats')`\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Keyword arguments**: When you’re calling a function, you can specify arguments in the form ‍`<keyword>=<value>‍`. In that case, each `<keyword>` must match a parameter in the Python function definition. For example, the previously defined function `f()` may be called with keyword arguments as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f(qty=6, item='bananas', price=1.74)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- we use this kind of functions when the arguments are high.\n",
    "- You can call a function using both positional and keyword arguments (all the positional arguments must come first, before any keyword arguments)\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "f(6, 'bananas', price=1.74)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3) **Deafult Parameters**: If a parameter specified in a Python function definition has the form `<name>=<value>`, then `<value>` becomes a default value for that parameter. Parameters defined this way are referred to as **default or optional parameters**. An example of a function definition with default parameters is shown below:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def f(qty=6, item='bananas', price=1.74):\n",
    "    print(f'{qty} {item} cost ${price:.2f}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In Python, **default parameter values** are **defined only once** when the function is defined (that is, when the def statement is executed). The default value isn’t re-defined each time the function is called. Thus, each time you call `f()` without a parameter, you’re performing `.append()` on the same list. So, in order to solve this, we should do as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(my_list=None):\n",
    "    if my_list is None:\n",
    "        my_list = []\n",
    "    my_list.append('###')\n",
    "    return my_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pass-By-Value and Pass-By-Reference \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass-by-value:** A copy of the argument is passed to the function.\n",
    "- **Pass-by-reference:** A reference to the argument is passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are parameters in Python pass-by-value or pass-by-reference? The answer is they’re neither, exactly. That’s because a reference doesn’t mean quite the same thing in Python as it does in Pascal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Python, every piece of data is an **object**. A reference points to an object, not a specific memory location. That means assignment isn’t interpreted the same way in Python as it is in a programming language such as Pascal. Let's see what happen in Python: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "These assignment statements have the following meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The first statement** causes `x` to point to an object whose value is `5`.\n",
    "- **The next statement** reassigns `x` as a new reference to a different object whose value is `10`. Stated another way, the second assignment rebinds `x` to a different object with value `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you pass an argument to a function, a similar **rebinding** occurs. Consider this example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(fx):\n",
    "    print('fx =', fx, '/ id(fx) = ', id(fx))#for checking what is happening\n",
    "    fx = 10\n",
    "    print('fx =', fx, '/ id(fx) = ', id(fx))#for checking what is happening\n",
    "    \n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "f(x)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "`x` would be `5` and `f(x)` would be `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "Argument passing in Python is somewhat of a hybrid between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference. What gets passed to the function is a reference to an object, but the reference is passed by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Python’s argument-passing mechanism has been called **pass-by-assignment**. This is because parameter names are bound to objects on function entry in Python, and assignment is also the process of binding a name to an object. You may also see the terms pass-by-object, pass-by-object-reference, or pass-by-sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argument passing in Python can be summarized as follows. **Passing an immutable object**, like an `int`, `str`, `tuple`, or `frozenset`, to a Python function acts like pass-by-value. The function can’t modify the object in the calling environment.\n",
    "**Passing a mutable object** such as a `list`, `dict`, or `set` acts somewhat—but not exactly—like pass-by-reference. The function can’t reassign the object wholesale, but it can change items in place within the object, and these changes will be reflected in the calling environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Statement\n",
    "A `return` statement in a Python function serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It immediately terminates the function and passes execution control back to the caller.\n",
    "2. It provides a mechanism by which the function can pass data back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This sort of paradigm can be useful for **error checking** in a function. You can check several error conditions at the start of the function, with `return` statements that bail out if there’s a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    if error_cond1:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    if error_cond2:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    if error_cond3:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "\n",
    "    <normal processing>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to exiting a function, the `return` statement is also used to pass data back to the caller. If a `return` statement inside a Python function is followed by an expression, then in the calling environment, the function call evaluates to the value of that expression\n",
    "- A function can return any type of **object**. In Python, that means pretty much anything whatsoever. In the calling environment, the function call can be used syntactically in any way that makes sense for the type of object the function returns.\n",
    "- If multiple comma-separated expressions are specified in a `return` statement, then they’re packed and returned as a `tuple`\n",
    "- When no return value is given, a Python function returns the special Python value `None`. The same thing happens if the function body doesn’t contain a `return` statement at all and the function falls off the end\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"variable-length_argument_lists\"></a>\n",
    "## Variable-Length Argument Lists\n",
    "In some cases, when you’re defining a function, you may not know beforehand how many arguments you’ll want it to take. Suppose, for example, that you want to write a Python function that computes the average of several values.\n",
    "- one sultion is using list or tuple to pass the arguments. However, the drawback is that the added step of having to group the values into a list or tuple is probably not something the user of the function would expect, and it isn’t very elegant. Whenever you find Python code that looks inelegant, there’s probably a better option. \n",
    "- The BEST solution is use **Arugment Tuple Packing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Argument Tuple Packing \n",
    "When a parameter name in a Python function definition is preceded by an asterisk (`*`), it indicates **argument tuple packing**. Any corresponding arguments in the function call are packed into a tuple that the function can refer to by the given parameter name. Here’s an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(*args):\n",
    "    print(args)\n",
    "    print(type(args), len(args))\n",
    "    for x in args:\n",
    "        print(x)\n",
    "        \n",
    "f(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "----- Answer -----\n",
    "(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "<class 'tuple'> 3\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Argument Tuple Unpacking \n",
    "An analogous operation is available on the other side of the equation in a Python function call. When an argument in a function call is preceded by an asterisk (`*`), it indicates that the argument is a tuple that should be **unpacked** and passed to the function as separate values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(x, y, z):\n",
    "    print(f'x = {x}')\n",
    "    print(f'y = {y}')\n",
    "    print(f'z = {z}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "f(1, 2, 3)\n",

    "x = foo\n",
    "y = bar\n",
    "z = baz\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** Although this type of unpacking is called **tuple** unpacking, it doesn’t only work with tuples. The asterisk (`*`) operator can be applied to any iterable in a Python function call. For example, a list or set can be unpacked as well:\n",
    "### Argument Dictionary packing/unpacking \n",
    "Python has a similar operator, the double asterisk (`**`), which can be used with Python function parameters and arguments to specify **dictionary packing and unpacking**. Preceding a parameter in a Python function definition by a double asterisk (`**`) indicates that the corresponding arguments, which are expected to be `key=value` pairs, should be packed into a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(**kwargs):\n",
    "    print(kwargs)\n",
    "    print(type(kwargs))\n",

    "foo -> 1\n",
    "bar -> 2\n",
    "baz -> 3\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the arguments `foo=1`, `bar=2`, and `baz=3` are packed into a dictionary that the function can reference by the name `kwargs`. Again, any name can be used, but the peculiar `kwargs` (which is short for **keyword args**) is nearly standard. You don’t have to adhere to it, but if you do, then anyone familiar with Python coding conventions will know straightaway what you mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argument dictionary unpacking** is analogous to argument tuple unpacking. When the double asterisk (`**`) precedes an argument in a Python function call, it specifies that the argument is a dictionary that should be unpacked, with the resulting items passed to the function as keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(a, b, c):\n",
    "    print(F'a = {a}')\n",

    "```\n",
    "The items in the dictionary `d` are unpacked and passed to `f()` as keyword arguments. So, `f(**d)` is equivalent to `f(a='foo', b=25, c='qux')`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it All Together\n",
    "Think of `*args` as a variable-length positional argument list, and `**kwargs` as a variable-length keyword argument list.\n",

It can contain the function’s purpose, what arguments it takes, information about return values, or any other information you think would be useful.\n",
    "The following is an example of a function definition with a docstring:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def avg(*args):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Returns the average of a list of numeric values.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return sum(args) / len(args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-line docstrings** are used for lengthier documentation. A multi-line docstring should consist of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed description. The closing quotes should be on a line by themselves:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def foo(bar=0, baz=1):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Perform a foo transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keyword arguments:\n",
    "    bar -- magnitude along the bar axis (default=0)\n",
    "    baz -- magnitude along the baz axis (default=1)\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # <function_body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Docstring formatting and semantic conventions are detailed in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the ways to access docstring of each function in python:\n",
    "1. You can access a function’s docstring with the expression `<function_name>.__doc__`.\n",
    "2. In the interactive Python interpreter, you can type `help(<function_name>)` to display the docstring for `<function_name>`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotations \n",
    "As of version 3.0, Python provides an additional feature for documenting a function called a **function annotation**. Annotations provide a way to attach metadata to a function’s parameters and return value.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(a: float, b: float = 8) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add two number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    :param a: First input\n",
    "    :param b: Second input\n",
    "    :return: Sum of two numbers.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "To add an annotation to a Python function parameter, insert a colon (`:`) followed by any expression after the parameter name in the function definition. To add an annotation to the return value, add the characters `->` and any expression between the closing parenthesis of the parameter list and the colon that terminates the function header. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(a: '<a>', b: '<b>') -> '<ret_value>':\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "The annotation for parameter `a` is the string `'<a>'`, for `b` the string `'<b>'`, and for the function return value the string `'<ret_value>'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.__annotations__\n",
    "f.__annotations__['a']\n",
    "----- Answer -----\n",
    "{'a': int, 'b': int, 'return': int}\n",
    "int\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An annotation can even be a composite object like a list or a dictionary, so it’s possible to attach multiple items of metadata to the parameters and return value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def area(\n",
    "    r: {\n",
    "           'desc': 'radius of circle',\n",
    "           'type': float\n",
    "       }) -> \\\n",
    "       {\n",
    "           'desc': 'area of circle',\n",
    "           'type': float\n",
    "       }:\n",
    "    return 3.14159 * (r ** 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "area.__annotations__['r']['desc']\n",
    "area.__annotations__['return']['type']\n",
    "----- Answer -----\n",
    "'radius of circle'\n",
    "float\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "```"
