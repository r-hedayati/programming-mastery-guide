    "## Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming paradigm can be termed as an approach or a style of writing code. Most of the modern programming languages fall into two general paradigms: imperative (procedural, OOP etc.) and declarative(functional etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular examples of **declarative languages** are database query languages such as **SQL, markup languages like HTML and CSS, and in functional and logic programming languages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular examples of **imperative languages** are **Java,C++ and C#**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declarative programming is a paradigm describing **WHAT** the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow. Imperative programming is a paradigm describing **HOW** the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.\n",

    "# Object Oriented Programming in Python \n",
    "**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.\n",
    "Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product. An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on an assembly line, and behavior, like the action each assembly line component performs.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Define a Class in Python\n",
    "Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called **methods**, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t necessarily contain any data. The `Dog` class specifies that a name and an age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn’t contain the name or age of any specific dog.\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an **instance** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the `Dog` class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "All class definitions start with the ‍`class‍` keyword, which is followed by the name of the class and a colon. Any code that is indented below the class definition is considered part of the class’s body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a ‍`Dog` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the `Dog` class consists of a single statement: the `pass` keyword. pass is often used as a placeholder indicating where code will eventually go. It allows you to run this code without Python throwing an error.\n",
    "> **Note:** Python class names are written in CapitalizedWords notation (**Pascal** case) by convention. For example, a class for a specific breed of dog like the Jack Russell Terrier would be written as `JackRussellTerrier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties that all `Dog` objects must have are defined in a method called `.__init__()`. Every time a new `Dog` object is created, `.__init__()` sets the initial **state** of the object by assigning the values of the object’s properties. That is, `.__init__()` initializes each new instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give `.__init__()` any number of parameters, but the first parameter will always be a variable called `self`. When a new class instance is created, the instance is automatically passed to the self parameter in `.__init__()` so that new **attributes** can be defined on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `self.name = name` creates an attribute called `name` and assigns to it the value of the `name` parameter.\n",
    "2. `self.age = age` creates an attribute called age and assigns to it the value of the `age` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes created in `.__init__()` are called **instance attributes**. An instance attribute’s value is specific to a particular instance of the class. All `Dog` objects have a `name` and an `age`, but the values for the `name` and `age` attributes will vary depending on the `Dog` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Class attribute\n",
    "    species = \"Canis familiaris\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **class attributes** are attributes that have the same value for all class instances. You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of `.__init__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class attributes are defined directly beneath the first line of the class name and are indented by four spaces. They must always be assigned an initial value. When an instance of the class is created, class attributes are automatically created and assigned to their initial values.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Instantiate an Object in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new object from a class is called **instantiating** an object. You can instantiate a new `Dog` object by typing the name of the class, followed by opening and closing parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# Creating a new instance (object) of a DOG class: \n",
    "# this will assign a memory address to the new object\n",
    "Dog(\"Pishi\", 21) \n",
    "Dog() #--> TypeError: __init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'name' and 'age'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assigning a variable to a new object\n",
    "a = Dog(\"seed\", 19)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Dog class’s `.__init__()` method has three parameters, so why are only two arguments passed to it in the example?\n",
    "> When you instantiate a Dog object, Python creates a new instance and passes it to the first parameter of `.__init__()`. This essentially removes the `self` parameter, so you only need to worry about the `name` and `age` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you create the `Dog` instances, you can access their instance attributes using **dot notation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a.name\n",
    "a.age\n",
    "a.species\n",
    "--- ANS ---\n",
    "'seed'\n",
    "19\n",
    "'Canis familiaris'\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "#Although the attributes are guaranteed to exist, their values _can_ be changed dynamically:\n",
    "a.age = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"instance_methods\"></a>\n",
    "### Instance Methods\n",
    "**Instance methods** are functions that are defined inside a class and can only be called from an instance of that class. Just like `.__init__()`, an instance method’s first parameter is always `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # ------------------------------------ #\n",
    "    # Leave other parts of Dog class as-is #\n",
    "    # ------------------------------------ #\n",
    "    species = \"Canis familiaris\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Instance method\n",
    "    def description(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is {self.age} years old\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Another instance method\n",
    "    def speak(self, sound):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says {sound}\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # -------------------------------------- #\n",
    "    # Replace .description() with __str__()  #\n",
    "    # -------------------------------------- #\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is {self.age} years old\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This `Dog` class has two instance methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `.description()` returns a string displaying the name and age of the dog.\n",
    "2. `.speak()` has one parameter called `sound`\n",
    "3. `.__str__()` a special instance method for printing.\n",
    "and returns a string containing the dog’s name and the sound the dog makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "miles = Dog(\"Miles\", 4)\n",
    "miles.description()\n",
    "miles.speak(\"Woof Woof\")\n",
    "print(miles)\n",
    "--- ANS ---\n",
    "'Miles is 4 years old'\n",
    "'Miles says Woof Woof'\n",
    "'Miles is 4 years old'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods like `.__init__()` and `.__str__()` are called **dunder methods** because they begin and end with double underscores. There are many dunder methods that you can use to customize classes in Python. Although too advanced a topic for a beginning Python tutorial, understanding dunder methods is an important part of mastering object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Other Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a doubt, when writing a class you'll always want to go for new-style classes. The perks of doing so are numerous, to list some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support for descriptors. Specifically, the following constructs are made possible with descriptors:\n",
    "- `classmethod`: A method that receives the class as an implicit argument instead of the instance.\n",
    "- `staticmethod`: A method that does not receive the implicit argument self as a first argument.\n",
    "- properties with property: Create functions for managing the getting, setting and deleting of an attribute.\n",
    "- `__slots__`: Saves memory consumptions of a class and also results in faster attribute access. Of course, it does impose limitations.\n",
    "- The `__new__` static method: lets you customize how new class instances are created.\n",
    "- Method resolution order (MRO): in what order the base classes of a class will be searched when trying to resolve which method to call.\n",
    "- Related to MRO, super calls. Also see, super() considered super.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dir` function's output shows the class methods and attributes.\n",
    "Python provides a `__bases__` attribute on each class that can be used to obtain a list of classes the given class inherits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All classes in Python are objects of the type class, and this type class is called Metaclass.\n",
    "- Each class in Python, by default, inherits from the `object` base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`type` and `object` are special in that they are the base of the type hierarchy. Everything is an instance of `object`. Every type/class is an instance of `type`. So `type` is an instance of `object` and `object` is also an instance of `type`. There is also a cycle: `type` and `object` are instances of each other. This kind of mutual inheritance is not normally possible, but that's the way it is for these fundamental types in Python: they break the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object creation in Python is a two-step process**. In the first step, Python creates the object, and in the second step, it initializes the object. Most of the time, we are only interested in the second step (i.e., the initialization step). Python uses the `__new__` method in the first step (i.e., object creation) and uses the `__init__` method in the second step (i.e., initialization).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__call__` method is a magic method in Python that is used to make the objects callable. Callable objects are objects that can be called. For example, functions are callable objects, as they can be called using the round parenthesis."
