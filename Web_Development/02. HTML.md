# HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages. It consists of elements that define the structure and content of a web page.
- **HTML elements** are the building blocks of HTML pages. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. The content is the information that is displayed on the web page.
- **HTML tags** are used to specify the type of element. For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph, and the `<img>` tag is used to define an image. Ref to [HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp). The structure of tags is as follows:
    ``` html
    <tagname> content </tagname>
    ```
    Although, some tags do not have a closing tag, such as the `<img>`,`<br>`, and `hr` tag.
- **HTML attributes** provide additional information about the elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: `name="value"`.
    ``` html
    <tagname attribute="value"> content </tagname>
    ```
- **HTML comments** are used to add notes to the code that are not displayed on the web page. Comments are enclosed in `<!--` and `-->`.
    ``` html
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    ```
- **HTML structure**: An HTML document consists of the following elements:
  - **Document type declaration**: The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
  - **HTML head**: The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
  - **HTML body**: The `<body>` element contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and links.
    ``` html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title> Page Title </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1> This is a heading </h1>
            <p> This is a paragraph. </p>
        </body>
    </html>
    ``` 
## Some Useful Tags
The following are some useful tags:
- **Heading tags**: HTML has six levels of headings, which are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. The `<h1>` tag is used for the main heading, and the `<h2>` to `<h6>` tags are used for subheadings.
    ``` html
    <h1> HEADING level 1 </h1>
    <h2> HEADING level 2 </h2>
    ```
- **Break tag**: The `<br>` tag is used to insert a line break in the text. It is an empty tag, which means it does not have a closing tag.
    ``` html
    <br>
    ```
- **Paragraph tag**: The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph. It is a block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the page.
    ``` html   
    <p> This is a paragraph. </p>
    ```
- **Image tag**: The `<img>` tag is used to insert an image into the web page. It has two required attributes: `src` and `alt`. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image, and the `alt` attribute specifies the alternative text for the image.
    ``` html
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
    ```
- **Link tag**: The `<a>` tag is used to create a hyperlink. It has an `href` attribute that specifies the URL of the page to which the link points.
    ``` html
    link to <a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>
    ```
- **List tags**: HTML has two types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`). Both types of lists contain list items (`<li>`).
    ``` html
    <ul>
        <li> Item 1 </li>
        <li> Item 2 </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Item 1 </li>
        <li> Item 2 </li>
    </ol>
    ```
- **Center tag**: The `<center>` tag is used to center-align the content of a web page. It is a block-level element, which means it takes up the full width of the page.
    ``` html
    <center> This content is centered. </center>
    ```

- **Table tag**: The `<table>` tag is used to create a table. It contains three types of elements: rows (`<tr>`), columns (`<td>`), and headers (`<th>`).
    ``` html
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> Header 1 </th>
            <th> Header 2 </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> Row 1, Column 1 </td>
            <td> Row 1, Column 2 </td>
        </tr>
