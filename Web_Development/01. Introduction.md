# Definitions
- **Internet**: The Internet is a global network of computers that are connected to each other. It allows computers to communicate with each other and share information.
- **HTTP Request**: HTTP request is a message sent from the client to the server. The message consists of a request line, headers, and a body. The request line contains the method, the URL, and the HTTP version. The headers contain additional information, such as the host, the user agent, and the content type. The body contains the data that is sent to the server.
- **Web Server**: Web server is a software that listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients and returns an HTTP response. The response contains a status code, headers, and a body. The status code indicates whether the request was successful, and the body contains the data that is sent to the client.
- **Client**: The Client is a software that sends HTTP requests to a server and receives HTTP responses. The client can be a web browser, a mobile app, or any other software that communicates with a server over the internet.
- **Domain Name Server**: Domain Name Server (DNS) is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses. When a client sends an HTTP request to a server, it uses the domain name to find the IP address of the server. The DNS server is responsible for translating the domain name into the IP address.
- **Uniform Resource Locator**: Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a string that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. The URL consists of a protocol, a domain name, a port number, a path, and a query string. 
  - The protocol specifies the communication protocol, such as HTTP or HTTPS. 
  - The domain name specifies the name of the server. 
  - The port number specifies the port on which the server is listening. 
  - The path specifies the location of the resource on the server. 
  - The query string specifies additional parameters that are sent to the server.
- **HTML**: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages. It consists of elements that define the structure and content of a web page. 
  - HTML elements are enclosed in **tags**, which are used to specify the type of element. For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph, and the `<img>` tag is used to define an image.
- **CSS**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to define the appearance of a web page. It consists of rules that specify the style of elements on a web page, such as the color, font, and size. CSS rules are applied to HTML elements using selectors, which specify the elements to which the rule applies.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive web pages. It allows developers to add dynamic content to web pages, such as animations, interactive forms, and real-time updates. JavaScript code is executed in the browser and can interact with the HTML and CSS of a web page.
